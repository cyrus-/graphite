Plug-In Installation
--------------------
The .jar file in /eclipse/plugins directory can be dropped into the dropins directory in your Eclipse installation.

The @GraphitePalette Annotation
-------------------------------
To annotate your Java classes with the GraphitePalette annotation, its definition must be available. This is available as a .jar file in /java.

Development
-----------
The /eclipse directory can be imported as a project into Eclipse if you have the Plug-In Development tools installed (you can find it using Eclipse's built-in plug-in installer, for example.)

Pretty simple all-around! Contact us if you have any trouble.
